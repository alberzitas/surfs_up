# Surfs Up

## Overview and Purpose

The purpose of this project is to collect data on temperatures and precipitation data in Hawaii for the months of June and December to present to the investor W. Avy. To do this, we used python, pandas, and SQLAlchemy to retrieve the temperatures, create a DataFrame using the information, and generate the data into a list.

## Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to assess the data that was produced from the script and to come up with a conclusion about the temperture and precipitation during the months in question.

### Results

### Summary

Based on the results of the query, it appears that the temperature is pretty consistent at around 75-80ยบ in June and an average of 71ยบ in December. The precipitation in December ranges between 0-2.4 inches a day. Based on this data, W. Avy can be pretty certain that the temperature should be ideal for a surf shop during the summer.
